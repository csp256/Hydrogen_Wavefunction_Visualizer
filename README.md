This uses the marching cubes algorithm (implementation not by me), and the three.js wrapper for OpenGL to show iso-probable surfaces of the Hydrogen wavefunction, given quantum numbers n, m, & l. 

The isosurface level can be changed with the top slider in the GUI, while order-of-magnitude changes may be made by the slider immediately below it.

It seems to work best on Chrome under Windows. The five HTML files in this project correspond to varying levels of detail. Start with Visualizer3.html or less (increase if your computer handles it well).

Code is not guaranteed to be clear.
